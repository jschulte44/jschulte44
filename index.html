            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Joyce Garcia has dedicated 40 years to serving the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District
                (HLPUSD). As a mother of three HLPUSD graduates, a 28-year school manager, and a 16-year
                leader with SEIU Local 99, Joyce&#39;s commitment to the district is deeply personal and
                professional. <br/><br/>
                Throughout her career, Joyce has specialized in school nutrition, ensuring students receive
                healthy meals daily. Her hands-on experience as a swimming, basketball, and volleyball coach
                and 15 years of volunteer work highlights her focus on the well-being and development of
                every child in the district. <br/><br/>
                Joyce&#39;s commitment to education is not just professional but deeply personal. Her son serves in
                the United States Army&#39;s Special Task Force, while her daughters have graduated from
                prestigious institutions, UCLA and UC Berkeley. These experiences underscore her belief in the
                power of a quality education, inspiring her to advocate for the same for all children.
                Joyce&#39;s platform centers on three key priorities: putting children&#39;s education first by expanding
                pathways to trade schools and colleges, supporting teachers and classified staff to provide
                world-class education, and ensuring school safety by maintaining a dedicated school police
                department. <br/><br/>
                Joyce Garcia is running for the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Trustee Area 1
                because she believes every child deserves the best possible education in a safe and supportive
                environment. Serving on the school board would be the most incredible privilege of her life,
                allowing her to continue her lifelong mission of advocating for children, families, and educators
                and ensuring that this belief is upheld.</p>
